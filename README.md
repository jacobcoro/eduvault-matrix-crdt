Learn about the database in the [`/src/model/database/README.md`](https://github.com/jacobcoro/eduvault-matrix-crdt/tree/main/src/model/database) file.

Experience the real-time sync by using the app from 2 different browsers.

Works best in Chrome. Right now firefox is able to send real-time updates, but for some reason receives them more slowly.
